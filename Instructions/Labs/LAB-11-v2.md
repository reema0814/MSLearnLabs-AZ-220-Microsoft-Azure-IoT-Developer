# Lab 11: Automate IoT Device Management with Azure IoT Hub

### Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you’ll explore how IoT devices, which may use optimized or minimal operating systems, update their firmware. Firmware updates are essential for maintaining and improving device functionality and are now commonly managed over the air (OTA) rather than manually. The process involves acquiring firmware from an online source, which is identified by a unique version, and storing it locally before applying the update. You'll need to understand device-specific requirements and work with manufacturers or hardware developers to handle these updates effectively. Azure IoT Hub offers advanced support for implementing device management operations on single devices and on collections of devices. The [Automatic Device Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-auto-device-config) feature enables you to simply configure a set of operations, trigger them, and then monitor their progress.

## Lab Scenario

The automated air processing system that you implemented in Contoso's cheese caves has helped the company to raise its already high-quality bar. The company has more award-winning cheeses than ever before.

Your base solution consists of IoT devices that are integrated with sensors and a climate control system to provide real-time control of temperature and humidity within a multi-chamber cave system. You also developed a simple back-end app that demonstrated the ability to manage devices using both direct methods and device twin properties.

Contoso has extended the simple back-end app from your initial solution to include an online portal that operators can use to monitor and remotely manage the cave environment. With the new portal, operators can even customize the temperature and humidity within the cave based on the type of cheese or for a specific phase within the cheese aging process. Each chamber or zone within the cave can be controlled separately.

The IT department will be maintaining the back-end portal that they developed for the operators, but your manager has agreed to manage the device side of the solution.

For you, this means two things:

1. The Operations team at Contoso is always looking for ways to make improvements. These improvements often lead to requests for new features in the device software.

1. The IoT devices that are deployed to cave locations need the latest security patches to ensure privacy and prevent hackers from taking control of the system. In order to maintain system security, you need to keep the devices up to date by remotely updating their firmware.

You plan to implement features of IoT Hub that enable automatic device management and device management at scale.
