# Lab 11: Introduction to Azure IoT Edge

## Introduction to Azure IoT Edge

## Lab Scenario

To encourage local consumers in a global marketplace, Contoso has partnered with local artisans to produce cheese in new regions around the globe.

Each location supports multiple production lines that are equipped with the mixing and processing machines that are used to create the local cheeses. Currently, the facilities have IoT devices connected to each machine. These devices stream sensor data to Azure and all data is processed in the cloud.

Due to the large amount of data being collected and the urgent time response needed on some of the machines, Contoso wants to use an IoT Edge gateway device to bring some of the intelligence to the edge for immediate processing. A portion of the data will still be sent to the cloud. Bringing data intelligence to the IoT Edge also ensures that they will be able to process data and react quickly even if the local network is poor.

You have been tasked with prototyping the Azure IoT Edge solution. To begin, you will be setting up an IoT Edge device that monitors temperature (simulating a device connected to one of the cheese processing machines). You will then deploy a Stream Analytics module to the device that will be used to calculate the average temperature and generate an alert notification if process control values are exceeded.

The following resources will be created:

1. To ensure the IoT Edge daemon is running, enter the following command:

    ``` bash
    sudo iotedge system status
    ```
   A successful response will be similar to:
   
    ``` bash
    System services:
    aziot-edged             Running
    aziot-identityd         Running
    aziot-keyd              Running
    aziot-certd             Running
    aziot-tpmd              Ready

    Use 'iotedge system logs' to check for non-fatal errors.
    Use 'iotedge check' to diagnose connectivity and configuration issues.
    ```  

1. To verify the IoT Edge runtime has connected, run the following command:

    ``` bash
    sudo iotedge check
    ```
   This runs a number of checks and displays the results. For this lab, ignore the Configuration checks warnings/errors. The final         Connectivity checks should succeed and be similar to:

    ``` bash
    Connectivity checks
    -------------------
    √ container on the default network can connect to IoT Hub AMQP port - OK
    √ container on the default network can connect to IoT Hub HTTPS / WebSockets port - OK
    √ container on the default network can connect to IoT Hub MQTT port - OK
    √ container on the IoT Edge module network can connect to IoT Hub AMQP port - OK
    √ container on the IoT Edge module network can connect to IoT Hub HTTPS / WebSockets port - OK
    √ container on the IoT Edge module network can connect to IoT Hub MQTT port - OK
    ```

### Exercise 3: Add Edge Module to Edge Device

When a new module instance is created by the IoT Edge runtime, it gets a corresponding module identity. The module identity is stored in IoT Hub, and is used as the addressing and security scope for all local and cloud communications for that module instance. In implementation, modules images exist as container images in a repository, and module instances are containers on devices. The only supported container engine for IoT Edge devices in production is Moby.

In this exercise, you will add a Simulated Temperature Sensor as a custom IoT Edge module, and deploy it to run on the IoT Edge Device.

#### Task 1: Configure module for deployment

1. Search for **IoT Hub** and select it.

1. Open **iot-az220-training-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"></inject>**, click on **Iot Edge (1)** under **Device Management** tab in the left pane and select **sensor-th-0067 (2)**.

1. Scroll to the bottom of the **sensor-th-0067** blade.Scroll down to find the **Modules (1)** section and notice the list of the modules currently configured for the device.

      Currently, the IoT Edge device is configured with only the Edge Agent ($edgeAgent) and Edge Hub ($edgeHub) modules that are part 
      of the IoT Edge Runtime.

      At the top of the **sensor-th-0067** blade, click **Set Modules (2)**.

   ![](./media/az11-22.png)

1. On the **Set modules on device: **sensor-th-0067** blade**, locate the **IoT Edge Modules** section. Click Add, and then select **IoT Edge Module**.

   ![](./media/az11-21.png)

1. On the Add IoT Edge Module pane, under IOT Edge Module Name, enter **tempsensor (1)**. Under Image URI, enter **mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-simulated-temperature-sensor:1.0. (2)**

      > **Note**: This image is a published image on Docker Hub that is provided by the Azure product group to support this testing scenario.

   ![](./media/az11-20.png)

1. Click on Module Twin Settings (1), to specify the desired properties for the module twin, enter the following **JSON (2)** and click on **Add (3)**:

    ```json
    {
        "EnableProtobufSerializer": false,
        "EventGeneratingSettings": {
            "IntervalMilliSec": 500,
            "PercentageChange": 2,
            "SpikeFactor": 2,
            "StartValue": 20,
            "SpikeFrequency": 20
        }
    }
    ```

      > **Note**: This JSON configures the Edge Module by setting the desired properties of its module twin.

      ![](./media/az11-19.png)

1. On the **Set modules on device: sensor-th-0067** blade, at the bottom of the blade, click **Next: Routes >**.

1. Provide the following details and click on **Review + create (3)**:

    * Name: **route (1)**
    * Value: **`FROM /messages/* INTO $upstream` (2)**

    This route will send all messages from all modules on the IoT Edge Device to IoT Hub

      ![](./media/az11-18.png)

1. At the bottom of the blade, to finish setting the modules for the device, click **Create**.

1. On the **sensor-th-0067** blade, under **Modules**, notice that **tempsensor** is now listed.

    > **Note**: You may have to click **Refresh** to see the module listed for the first time.

    You may notice that the RUNTIME STATUS for **tempsensor** is not reported.

     ![](./media/az11-17.png)

1. At the top of the blade, click **Refresh**.

1. Notice that the **RUNTIME STATUS** for the **tempsensor** module is now set to **running**.

    If the value is still not reported, or if an error is reported, wait a moment and then refresh the blade again.

#### Task 2: Confirm module deployment

1. Open a Cloud Shell session (if it is not still open).

    If you are no longer connected to the **vm-az220-training-edge0001-{your-id}** virtual machine, connect using SSH as your did 
    earlier in this lab. The SSH command should be available in Notepad.

1. At the Cloud Shell command prompt, to list the modules currently running on the IoT Edge Device, enter the following command:

    ```bash
    iotedge list
    ```

      ![](./media/az11-16.png)
   
1. The output of the command look similar to the following.

    ```bash
    demouser@vm-az220-training-edge0001-{your-id}:~$ iotedge list
    NAME             STATUS           DESCRIPTION      CONFIG

    If it is closed or timed out, reconnect. Run the **SSH** command and login as before.

1. At the command prompt, to view a list of the modules deployed to the device, enter the following command:

    ```bash
    iotedge list
    ```

    It can take a minute for the new Stream Analytics module to be deployed to the IoT Edge Device. Once it's there, you will see it in the list output by this command.

    ```bash
    demouser@vm-az220-training-edge0001-{your-id}:~$ iotedge list
    NAME               STATUS           DESCRIPTION      CONFIG
    asa-az220-training-CP1119  running          Up a minute      mcr.microsoft.com/azure-stream-analytics/azureiotedge:1.0.5
    edgeAgent          running          Up 6 hours       mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-agent:1.0
    edgeHub            running          Up 4 hours       mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-hub:1.0
    tempsensor         running          Up 4 hours       mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-simulated-temperature-sensor
    ```

    > **Note**: If the Stream Analytics module does not show up in the list, wait a minute or two, then try again. It can take a minute for the module deployment to be updated on the IoT Edge Device.

1. At the command prompt, to watch the telemetry being sent from the Edge device by the **tempsensor** module, enter the following command:

    ```bash
    iotedge logs tempsensor
    ```

    > **Note**: If the simulated temperature sensor module stopped before the asa module was deployed, you can restart it by running the `iotedge restart tempsensor` command. Let it run for about 30 seconds and then recheck the logs.

1. Take a minute to observe the output.

    While watching the temperature telemetry being sent by **tempsensor**, notice that a **reset** command is sent by the Stream Analytics job when the **machine.temperature** reaches an average above **25**. This is the action configured in the Stream Analytics job query.

    Output of this event will look similar to the following:

    ```bash
    11/14/2019 22:26:44 - Send Json Event : {"machine":{"temperature":231.599999999999959,"pressure":1.0095600761599359},"ambient":{"temperature":21.430643635304012,"humidity":24},"timeCreated":"2019-11-14T22:26:44.7904425Z"}
