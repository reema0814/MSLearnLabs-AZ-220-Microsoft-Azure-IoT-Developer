# Lab 05: Integrate IoT Hub with Event Grid

### Estimated Duration: 120 minutes

## Lab Scenario

Contoso management is impressed with the prototype solutions that you've created using Azure IoT services, and they feel comfortable assigning additional budget the capabilities that you have already demonstrated. They are now asking that you explore the integration of certain operational support capabilities. Specifically, they would like to see how the Azure tools support sending alert notifications to the managers who are responsible for specific work areas. Alert criteria will be defined by the business area managers. The telemetry data arriving at IoT hub will be evaluated to generate the notifications.

You've identified a business manager, Nancy, that you've had success working with in the past. You'll work with her during the initial phase of your solution.

Nancy informs you that her team of facility technicians is responsible for installing the new connected thermostats that will be used to monitor temperature across different cheese caves. The thermostat devices function as IoT devices that can be connected to IoT hub. To get your project started, you agree to create an alert that will generate a notification when a new device has been implemented.

To generate an alert, you will push a device created event type to Event Grid when a new thermostat device is created in IoT Hub. You will create a Logic Apps instance that reacts to this event (on Event Grid) and which will send an email to alert facilities when a new device has been created, specifying the device ID and connection state.

## Lab Objectives

      > **Note**: In the next step you will be adding the **DeviceCreated** sample event schema to the Request Body JSON Schema textbox. This sample, along with a couple of other event schema samples and some associated documentation, can be found at the following link for those who want to learn more: [Azure Event Grid event schema for IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-schema-iot-hub)
      
      > **Note**: In the JSON replace the **id, subscription ID, resource group name, hub name** with the actual values. 

1. Copy the following sample JSON to the **Enter or paste a sample JSON payload.** textbox, and then click **Done**.

    ```json
    [{
      "id": "56afc886-767b-d359-d59e-0da7877166b2",
      "topic": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/<subscription ID>/RESOURCEGROUPS/<resource group name>/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.DEVICES/IOTHUBS/<hub name>",

      },
      "dataVersion": "1",
      "metadataVersion": "1"
    }]
    ```

      > **Note**: The **Enter or paste a sample JSON payload** field is a rich editor that automatically inserts opening and closing braces, etc. In the LODS environment, if the "type text" option is used to copy the JSON above directly into the **Enter or paste a sample JSON payload** field, extra braces will be added and the content will be invalid. Instead, open **Notepad** within the LODS VM first, and then send the text to **Notepad**. From there, you can copy the text into the field without error.

1. Notice that the **Request Body JSON Schema** textbox is now populated with a JSON schema that was automatically generated based on the sample JSON that you provided.

      ![](media/9lab11.png)

1. Below the **When a HTTP request is received** trigger, click **+(1)** and select **Add an action(2)**.

      ![](media/9lab12.png)

1. Click **Add an operation** and in the search textbox, enter **Outlook.com**

1. In the list of Actions, scroll down to the **Office 365 Outlook**, and then click **Send an email (V2)**.

      ![](media/az5-4.png)

      > **Note**:  These instructions walk through configuring the Logic App to send an email using an **Outlook.com** email address. Alternatively, the Logic App can also be configured to send email using the Office 365 Outlook or Gmail connectors as well.

1. On the **Outlook.com** connector, click **Sign in**, and then follow the prompts to authenticate with an existing Outlook.com account.

      ![](media/9lab14.png)

## Task 3: Configure Azure IoT Hub Event Subscription

Azure IoT Hub integrates with Azure Event Grid so that you can send event notifications to other services and trigger downstream processes. You can configure business applications to listen for IoT Hub events so that you can react to critical events in a reliable, scalable, and secure manner. For example, build an application that updates a database, creates a work ticket, and delivers an email notification every time a new IoT device is registered to your IoT hub.

In this exercise, you will create an Event Subscription within Azure IoT Hub to setup Event Grid integration that will trigger a Logic App to send an alert email.

1. Search for **Iot Hub** and select it. Select **iot-az220-training-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

      ![](media/az5-2.png)

1. On the **IoT Hub** blade, on the left side navigation menu, select **Events (1)**. On the **Events** pane, at the top, click **+ Event Subscription (2)**.

      ![](media/az5-1.png)

1. On the Create Event Subscription blade, provide the following settings (leave others with their defaults):

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | **MyDeviceCreateEvent (1)** |
    | EventSchema | **Event Grid Schema (2)** |
    | TOPIC DETAILS >> System Topic Name | **device-creation (3)** |
    | EVENT TYPES >> Filter to Event Types dropdown | De-select all of the choices except **Device Created(4)** |
    | ENDPOINT DETAILS >> Endpoint Type dropdown | **Web Hook (5)** |
    | ENDPOINT DETAILS | Click on **Configure an endpoint (6)** |
    | Select Web Hook | Paste the **URL** **(7)** that you copied from your logic app, then click **Confirm Selection(8)**. |

      ![](media/az5-8.png)

1. At the top of the pane, click on **Filters**. Under **ADVANCED FILTERS**, click on **Add new filter(1)**, and then fill in the fields with these values:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Key | **Subject (2)** |
    | Operator | Select **String begins with (3)** |
    | Value | Enter **devices/sensor-th (4)** |

1. To save the event subscription, click on **Create (5)**.

    ![](media/9lab22.png)

## Task 4: Test Your Logic App with New Devices

Test your logic app by creating a new device to trigger an event notification email.

1. On your Azure portal, navigate to your Iot Hub **iot-az220-training-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** blade if it is not displaying.

1. On the left side navigation menu, under **Device Management**, click on **Devices(1)**. At the top of the IoT devices blade, click on **+ Add Device(2)**.

    ![](media/9lab23.png)

1. In the **Device ID** field, enter **sensor-th-0050 (1)**. Leave all other fields at the defaults, and then click **Save (2)**.

    ![](media/9lab24.png)

1. To test the event subscription filters, create additional devices using the following device IDs:

    * `sensor-v-3002`
    * `sensor-th-0030`
    * `sensor-v-3003`

    If you added the four examples total, your list of IoT devices should look like the following image:

    ![](media/9lab25.png)

1. Copy the following link in a private window and sign with your **Username** and **Password** available in the VM's Environment tab.
   
    ```text
    https://outlook.office365.com/mail/
    ```
    ![](media/az5-9.png)

     > **Note**: You can see that only the devices starting with **sensor-th** have been triggered, as this is the configuration we set up in our event subscription.
   
      > **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
      > - Hit the Validate button for the corresponding task. If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task. Alternatively, you can navigate to the Lab Validation Page, from the upper right corner in the lab guide section.
      > - If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide. 
      > - If you need any assistance, please contact us at labs-support@spektrasystems.com. We are available 24/7 to help you out.
