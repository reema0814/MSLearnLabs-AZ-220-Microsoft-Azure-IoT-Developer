# Lab 09: Develop, Deploy, and debug a custom module on Azure IoT Edge with VS Code

### Estimated Duration: 120 minutes

## Lab Scenario

To help manage fluctuations in consumer demand, Contoso maintains a small inventory of ripened cheeses in a warehouse at each cheese making facility. These ripened wheels are sealed in wax and the storage environment is carefully controlled to ensure that the cheese remains in perfect condition. Contoso uses a conveyor system to move the large wax-sealed cheese wheels from the warehouse to the packaging facilities.

In the past, Contoso has run their packaging process at full capacity, processing all the cheese that is placed in the system. Any excess volume of packaged cheese was not an issue because it could be used for promotional offers, and additional cheese could be pulled from inventory as needed. However, with the significant growth that Contoso is experiencing, and with growing fluctuations due to worldwide demand, the company needs to automate the system in a way that helps to manage the volume of cheese being packaged.

Since you have already implemented the IoT solution that monitors the conveyor belt system in the packaging and shipping area, you have been tasked with developing a solution that helps to manage/control packaging volumes.

To ensure that the correct number of packages have been processed, you decide to create (and deploy to an IoT Edge device) a simple module that counts the number of packages detected on the conveyor belt system. You already have another module available that can be used to detect the packages (both modules be deployed to the same IoT Edge device).

    ```cmd/sh
    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    python get-pip.py
    ```

1. To verify that the Azure IoT EdgeHub Dev Tool is installed, run the following command:

    ```cmd/sh
    pip install iotedgehubdev --user
    ```

## Exercise 2: Create an Azure Container Registry

Azure Container Registry provides storage of private Docker images for container deployments. The service is a managed, private Docker registry service based on the open-source Docker Registry 2.0. Azure Container Registry is used to store and manage your private Docker container images.

When a new module instance is created by the IoT Edge runtime, it gets a corresponding module identity. The module identity is stored in IoT Hub and is used as the addressing and security scope for all local and cloud communications for that module instance. In implementation, modules images exist as container images in a repository, and module instances are containers on devices. The only supported container engine for IoT Edge devices in production is Moby.

In this exercise, you will use the Azure portal to create a new Azure Container Registry resource.

### Task 1: Create the container registry

In this task, you will create a Container Registry from Azure Portal.

1. On the Azure Portal, search for **Container registries** and select it.

## Exercise 3: Create Custom Edge Module in C#

In this exercise, you will create an Azure IoT Edge Solution that contains a custom Azure IoT Edge Module written in C#.

### Task 1: Create the solution

In this task, you will be using Visual Studio Code setup the IoT Edge Solution.

1. In the **Visual Studio Code** open, select **View** menu, and click on **Command Palette**.

      ![](./media2/lab13img13.png)

1. At the command prompt, type **Azure IoT Edge: New**, and then click **Azure IoT Edge: New IoT Edge Solution**.

      ![](./media2/lab13img14.png)

1. Browse to the folder `C:\Labfiles`, and then click **Select folder**.

1. When prompted for a solution name, enter **EdgeSolution**. This name will be used as the directory name for the new **IoT Edge Solution** that will be created.

1. When prompted to select a module template, click **C# Module**. This will define **C#** as the development language for the custom IoT Edge Module added to the solution.

1. When prompted for the name of the custom IoT Edge Module, enter **ObjectCountingModule**.

1. When prompted for name of the Docker image repository for the module, replace the **localhost:5000** part of the default "localhost:5000/objectcountingmodule" repository location with the name of the Azure Container Registry server - similar to **acraz220training<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />.azurecr.io**.
   
    ```text
    <acr-name>.azurecr.io/<module-name>
    ```

    > **Note**: Be sure to replace the placeholders with the appropriate values:
              - `<acr-name>`: Replace with the name of the Azure Container Registry service.
              - `<module-name>`: Replace with the name of the custom Azure IoT Edge Module that's being created.

    > **Note**:  The default Docker image repository in Visual Studio Code is set to `localhost:5000/<your module name>`. If you were to use a local Docker registry for testing, then **localhost** is fine.

    > **Important**: Make sure to remove any reference to port **5000** from your ACR references!  That port is used for a local Docker repository, but it not used in the ACR case.

1. Wait for Visual Studio Code to create the solution. Once the new **IoT Edge Solution** has been created, Visual Studio Code will open the solution.

    > **Note**: If Visual Studio Code prompts you to load required resources or C# extension, click **Yes**

    > **Note**: If Visual Studio Code prompts you to configure the **.env** file, select **Yes** and proceed to Task 2 below.

### Task 2: Configure the solution

In this task, you will be setting up your username and password in the solution.

1. In the **Explorer** pane, to open the .env file, click **.env**. The .env file is located in the root directory of the IoT Edge Solution. This is where the username and password are configured for accessing your Docker registry. The username and password are stored in this file using the following format:

    ```text
    CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USERNAME_<registry-name>=<registry-username>
    CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD_<registry-name>=<registry-password>
    ```
    >**Note**: Within your version of .env file, notice that the `<registry-name>` has already been added to the configuration values. The value that has been added should match the name of the Docker registry that you specified when creating the IoT Edge Solution.

1. Within the **.env** file, replace the placeholder values with the username and password values that you saved earlier. Save the updated **.env** file.

      ![](./media2/lab09img3updated.png)

     ![](./media2/lab13img16.png)

1. On the left side navigation menu, under **Security settings**, click **Shared access policies**. In the list of policies, click **iothubowner**.  copy the value for **Primary connection string**.

     ![](./media2/lab13img17.png)

      >**Note**: Record this value, as you will need it below.

1. On the left side navigation menu, under **Device management**, click **IoT Edge**. Click **Add an IoT Edge device**.

     ![](./media2/lab13img18.png)

1. On the **Create a device** blade, under **Device ID**,  enter **SimulatedDevice**. Leave all other settings as default, click on **save**.

     ![](./media2/lab13img19.png)

### Task 2: Configure the test module

In this task, you will be configuring the module using the connection string of device.

1. Switch to the **Visual Studio Code** instance containing your IoT Edge solution.

1. In the **Explorer** pane, right-click **deployment.debug.template.json**, and then click **Build and Run IoT Edge Solution in Simulator**.

      ![](./media2/lab13img1.png)

1. This file is the debugging deployment manifest file. It is located in the root directory of the IoT Edge Solution.

1. When the process begins, you will see a dialog open in the lower right corner of the windows that says, **Please setup iotedgehubdev first before starting simulator**.

1. When you see the prompt to setup iotedgehubdev, click **Setup**.

1. When prompted for the **IoT Hub Connection String**, enter the **Primary Connection string** you recorded earlier.

1. When prompted to **Select an IoT Edge Device**, click **SimulatedDevice**.

    > **Note**: If you get an **Unauthorized** error in the lower-right-hand corner, run the **Azure IoT Hub: Set IoT Hub Connection String** command from the Command Palette to reconfigure your simulator connection string, then run **Azure IoT Edge: Setup IoT Edge Simulator** from the command palette and try to select your device again.

    > **Note**: It is possible that you will be prompted for your Admin password on your local machine (in the Visual Studio Code **TERMINAL** window), particularly on Linux or macOS. Enter your password at the prompt and press **Enter**. The reason it might ask for your password is that the setup command for **iotedgehubdev** is being run using **sudo** as it requires elevated privileges.

1. Once the IoT Edge Simulator is set up successfully, a **Setup IoT Edge Simulator successfully** message will be displayed in the Visual Studio Code TERMINAL. Now when you build and run the module in the IoT Edge Simulator, it will run as expected.

### Task 3: Build and run the module

In this task, you will build the solution and run it as IoT Edge device which send telemetry data.
