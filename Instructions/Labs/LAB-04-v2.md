# Lab 04: Device Message Routing

### Estimated Duration: 120 minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you will begin by ensuring that your Azure subscription includes the required resources for this lab. You will then create a simulated device that sends vibration telemetry to your IoT hub. With your simulated data arriving at IoT hub, you will implement an IoT hub message route and Azure Stream Analytics job that can be used to process device messages (in both cases data will be delivered to a Blob storage container that is used to verify successful implementation).

## Lab Scenario

Contoso Management is impressed with your implementation of automatic device enrollment using DPS. They are now interested in having you develop an IoT-based solution related to product packaging and shipping.

The cost associated with packaging and shipping cheese is significant. To maximize cost efficiency, Contoso operates an on-premises packaging facility. The workflow is straightforward - cheese is cut and packaged, packages are assembled into shipping containers, containers are delivered to specific bins associated with their destination. A conveyor belt system is used to move the product through this process. The metric for success is the number of packages leaving the conveyor belt system during a given time period (typically a work shift).

The conveyor belt system is a critical link in this process and is visually monitored to ensure that the workflow is progressing at maximum efficiency. The system has three operator controlled speeds: stopped, slow, and fast. Naturally, the number of packages being delivered at the low speed is less than at the higher speed. However, there are a number of other factors to consider:

* The vibration level of the conveyor belt system is much lower at the slow speed
* High vibration levels can cause packages to fall from the conveyor
* High vibration levels are known to accelerate wear-and-tear of the system
* When vibration levels exceed a threshold limit, the conveyor belt must be stopped to allow for inspection (to avoid more serious failures)


## Lab Objectives
 
 - Exercise 1: Write Code to generate Vibration Telemetry
 - Exercise 2: Create a Message Route to Azure Blob Storage
 - Exercise 3: Create an Azure Stream Analytics Job

The following resources will be created:

## Exercise 1: Write Code to generate Vibration Telemetry

Both long term and real-time data analysis are required to automate the monitoring of Contoso's conveyor belt system and enable predictive maintenance. Since no historical data exists, your first step will be to generate simulated data that mimics vibration data and data anomalies in a realistic manner. Contoso engineers have developed an algorithm to simulate vibration over time and embedded the algorithm within a code class that you will implement. The engineers have agreed to support any future updates required to adjust the algorithms.

During your initial prototype phase, you will implement a single IoT device that generates telemetry data. In addition to the vibration data, your device will create some additional values (packages delivered, ambient temperature, and similar metrics) that will be sent to Blob storage. This additional data simulates the data that will be used to develop machine learning modules for predictive maintenance.

In this exercise, you will:

* Open the simulated device project
* Update the connection string for your simulated device and review the project code
* Test your simulated device connection and telemetry communications
* Ensure that telemetry is arriving at your IoT hub

## Exercise 2: Create a Message Route to Azure Blob Storage

IoT solutions often require that incoming message data be sent to multiple endpoint locations, either dependent upon the type of data or for business reasons. Azure IoT hub provides the _message routing_ feature to enable you to direct incoming data to locations required by your solution.

The architecture of our system requires data be processed in two ways: routed to a storage location for archiving data, streamed in real-time for immediate analysis.

Contoso's vibration monitoring scenario requires you to create the following message processes:

* the first process is an IoT hub route that delivers message data to an Azure Blob storage location for data archiving
* the second process is an Azure Stream Analytics job for real-time analysis


One of the easiest ways to filter data is to evaluate a message property. The code in your simulated device app configures the device-to-cloud messages as follows:

```csharp
...
telemetryMessage.Properties.Add("sensorID", "VSTel");
...
loggingMessage.Properties.Add("sensorID", "VSLog");
```

With the messaged tagged in this way, you can embed a SQL query within your IoT hub message route that uses the **sensorID** property as a criteria for choosing the messages that are processed by the route. In this case, when the value assigned to **sensorID** is **VSLog** (vibration sensor log), the message is intended for the storage archive (logging).

In this exercise, you will create and test the logging route.

### Task 1: Define the message routing endpoint

In this task, you will creating a routes using the message routing tab in the Azure IoT Hub.

1. In the Azure portal window, ensure that your IoT hub blade is open.

1. On the left-hand menu, under **Hub settings**, click **Message routing**. Ensure that the **Routes** tab is selected.

    ![](./media/lab7img10.png)

1. To add a new route, click **+ Add**.

    ![](./media/lab7img11.png)

1. On the **Add a route** blade,

    - Endpoint type: Select **Storage(1)** from the drop down.
    - Endpoint name: **vibrationLoggingRoute(2)** 
    - To display a list of Storage accounts associated with your subscription, click on **Pick a container(3)** under Azure Storage Container.

    ![](./media/az-4-7.png)

    A list of the storage accounts already present in the Azure Subscription is listed. At this point you could select an existing storage account and container, however, for this lab you will create a new one.

1. To begin creating a storage account, click **+ Storage account**.

    The **Create storage account** blade should now be displayed.

1. On the **Create storage account** blade, provide the following details and then click on **OK** **(3)**.

    - Name: Enter **vibrationstore<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (1)**
    - Account kind: **StorageV2 (general purpose v2) (2)**
    - Performance: Ensure that **Standard** is selected.
      
    ![](./media/lab7img12.png)

1. Wait until the request is validated and the storage account deployment has completed.

    Validation and creation can take a minute or two.

    Once completed, the **Create storage account** blade will close and the **Storage accounts** blade will be displayed if it did not appear refresh the page it will appear. The Storage accounts blade should have auto-updated to show the storage account that was just created.

### Task 2: Define the storage account container

In thi stask, you will create a storage account and a container for route.

1. On the **Storage accounts** blade, click **vibrationstore<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**.

    ![](./media/lab7img13.png)

    The **Containers** blade should appear. Since this is a new storage account, there are no containers listed.

1. To create a container, click **+ Container**.
   
    ![](./media/lab7img14.png)

    The **New container** dialog should now be displayed.

1. On the **New container** dialog, under **Name** enter **vibrationcontainer** and then click on **Create** to create the Container.

    ![](./media/lab7img15.png)
 
1. To choose this container for your solution, click **vibrationcontainer**, and then click **Select**.

    ![](./media/lab7img16.png)

1. Now on the **Add a route** page verify **Endpoint type(1)**, **Endpoint name(2)**, **Azure storage container(3)** and then click on **Create + next**.

    ![](./media/lab7img17.png)

      Notice that the **Endpoint** is now populated.

### Task 3: Define the routing query

In this task, you will define a route for storage account.

1. On the **Add a route** blade, under **Data source**, ensure that **Device Telemetry Messages** is selected.

    - Under Name: Enter **vibrationLoggingRoute**
    - Under **Data source**, ensure that **Device Telemetry Messages** is selected.
    - Under **Enable route**, ensure that **Enable** is selected.
    - Under **Routing query**, replace **true** with the query below:

    ```sql
    sensorID = 'VSLog'
    ```

    This query ensures that only messages with the **sensorID** application property set to **VSLog** will be routed to the storage endpoint.

    ![](./media/lab7img18.png)

1. To create this route, click on **Create + skip enrichments**.

    Wait for the success message. Once completed, the route should be listed on the **Message routing** pane.

1. Once you see your new route listed on the **Message routing** pane, navigate back to your Azure portal Dashboard.

    ![](./media/az-4-8.png)   

### Task 4: Verify Data Archival

In this task, you will verify that the data is properly archived or not by looking into your storage account.

1. Ensure that the device app you created in Visual Studio Code is still running.

    If not, run it in the Visual Studio Code terminal using **dotnet run**.

1. On your Resources tile, to open you Storage account blade, click on **vibrationstore<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**.

    ![](./media/lab7img19.png)
 
1. On the left-side menu of your **vibrationstore<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** blade, click on **Storage browser(1)** under **vibrationstore<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** then click on **Blob containers(2)** and then click on **vibrationcontainer(3)**

    ![](./media/az-4-14.png)

1. In the right-hand pane, under **NAME**, click **iot-az220-training-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**, and then use clicks to navigate down into the hierarchy.

    ![](./media/lab7img21.png)

    >**Note**: It may take some time for the folder to appear.

    Under your IoT hub folder, you will see folders for the Partition, then numeric values for the Year, Month, and Day. The final folder represents the Hour, listed in UTC time. The Hour folder will contain a number of Block Blobs that contain your logging message data.

1. Click the Block Blob for the data with the earliest time stamp.

    ![](./media/lab7img22.png)

    The .avro files use a naming pattern of **{num}.avro** (i.e. **22.avro**).

<validation step="3b54d486-5079-4a03-9643-9e2f099478d8" />

>**Congratulations** on completing the Task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:

  > - Hit the Validate button for the corresponding task. If you receive a success message, you have successfully validated the lab. 
  > - If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide.

## Exercise 3: Create an Azure Stream Analytics Job

In this exercise, you will create a Stream Analytics job that outputs live stream messages to a Blob storage container. You will then use the Storage browser to verify that your ASA job runs successfully.

This will enable you to verify that your ASA job processes message data to an output location using the following parameters:

* **Name** - vibrationJob
* **ASA job input** - IoT hub Messaging Endpoint
* **ASA job output** - Blob storage container
* **ASA job query** - pass through all messages from input to output

> **Note**: It may seem odd that in this lab you are using IoT hub routing to deliver device data to a storage location, and then also processing your device message data through an Azure Stream Analytics job with output to the same storage location. In a real-world scenario you probably wouldn't use both of these message processing tools for processing device data in this way. Instead, it's more common to use an ASA job to invoke a time sensitive action based on analysis of real-time data. However, since this lab is providing an introduction to both of these data processing tools, the Blob storage container provides an easy way to validate that your IoT hub route is working as expected and to show a simple implementation of Azure Stream Analytics.
